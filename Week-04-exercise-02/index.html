                    Transformers has always been my favorite movie franchise, and probably always will be. Ever since I was a childe I
                    was always so eager to see the newist movie in theaters with my family, and always waited for the next one to release.
                    Im not sure why I was originally drawn to the movies I just know that I always have been, and will never turn down the
                    opportunity to watch one with my friends and family.

                    The Lord of the rings trilogy was one of my dads favorite books and movies. And when he intoduced me to the franchise
                    I was hooked instantly, It quickly became my defonition of a fantacy world with the orks, elvs, and dworfs all potrayed
                    so well in the movies.It almost seems like it set a foundation for all fantacy novels and films with so many fallowing
                    in its footsteps.

                    Harry Potter is another franchise my dad had introduced me to, although as a childe it never realy grabed my attintion,
                    but as I grew older and more able to understand what is going on I began to truly love the films. Especily because I have never 
                    been an great reader and the size of the Harry Potter books where quite intimidating to me, having a movie to watch and 
                    be able to understand why it is such a highly prased franchise was great for me.

                    The Pirates of the caribean has always been one of my favorite movies franchises, but it also conects me to a lot of childhood 
                    memories, When I watch one of the films I am always flooded with memories of going to my cousins house where it almost seemed they 
                    would always have one of the Pirates of the caribean movies playing and I can remember being glud to the tv while not even knowing
                    what is going on around me just in aw of the amazing caractures and CGI that you just dont see in movies now days.

                    fallen in love with. I though the cars and paint jobs and engiens where always so cool just leaving me dreaming of having somthing
                    simular when I grew up. Although I dont have somthing like that now the movies have still imprented that dream in me and I still
                    hope to one day own a crazy decked out car.

                    out it seems like it was the only thing we could talk about. we had fallen in love with the action and adventure the movies brought
                    to the theaters. And where waiting for them to anounce more because we felt that one just wasent enough. Now three films later me and
                    my dad find ouselves in the same position we where in after the first one despritly waiting the the anounce of another.
