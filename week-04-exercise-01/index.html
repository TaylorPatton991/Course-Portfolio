        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" the Microsoft website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="devtools-vandalism.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the changes you made to the website using the browser's developer tools. Some potential questions
            to consider:
        <ul>
            <li>What text did you edit? I edited the main backround to black</li>
            <li>What CSS properties did you modify? everthing to alighn center rather than left</li>
            <li>What made your edits interesting or amusing? The way it changed the appearance of the website</li>
            <li>Did you understand why some changes worked and some didn't? Not completly, I changed a bunch of colors and never saw any change</li>
            <li>Why did you choose the changes you did? They seemed visibly noticable</li>
            <li>Were you able to understand how the HTML and CSS worked together to make the changes you made? Yes</li>
            <li>Do you think you have a better sense of how dev tools can be used while crafting your own webpages? Yes</li>
        </ul>
